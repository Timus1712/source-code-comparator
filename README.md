# Compare source codes for cheating
My diploma for Bachelor degree in Moscow Aviation Institute.

This tool can be used for compare sources in university/schools for cheating.

Available source code comprasion:
* C/C++

In future:
* Python
* Java
* Pascal/Delphi

You can get sources from some testing systems:
* ejudge (TODO)
* Codeforces (TODO)

## Install

## Usage

## How it works

Now it's compare two Abstract Syntax Tree.
The problem is to get good AST for compare. AST for C++ code generates by clang bindings for python.
